I am PhD scholar, specializing in deep learning for [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and computer vision. I am interested in development of deep learning models for short and informal text analysis. Deep learning models are data hungry, thus, acquiring a large scale annotated data to train robust deep learning models is costly. I am also interested in learning with minimal annotated data. My publications can be viewed [here](https://haroonshakeel.github.io/publications/).
