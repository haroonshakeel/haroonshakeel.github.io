10/6/2015	1- Virtualization security: analysis and open challenges	International Journal of Hybrid Information Technology (IJHIT)	"Virtualization has many applications within any organization. This makes possible virtual storage network and utilizing hardware resources efficiently. Virtualization also makes the foundations of cloud computing services, allowing users to use the hardware as an on-demand service. With all such advantages, there are also some security and privacy issues for utilizing any form of virtualization. The aim of this survey is to highlight such threats and techniques to solve these issues."	"Muhammad Arif, <strong>Muhammad Haroon Shakeel,</strong> (2015).

1/6/2018	"2- Medical Image Compression using DDCT, Ripplet transform and SPIHT"	International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research (IJSER)	"Medical images contain very significant information so very high quality images are used in medical image domain. These high quality images demand very high cost and bandwidth for storage and transmission. Therefore, image compression is very important in medical image processing. Main objective of the paper is to achieve high compression ratio and preserve 2D discontinuities/singularities as well as provide better representation of texture. In this paper, a new image compression technique is proposed. We use Directional Discrete Cosine Transform (DDCT) followed by Ripplet Transform and Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) coding. DDCT in combination with Ripplet provides better texture information and preserves 2D discontinuities/singularities. SPIHT provides better compression ratio. Experimental results show that proposed approach outperforms previous techniques in achievement of high compression ratio and texture representation."

7/3/2019	3- Deep Learning for Multi-Class Identification From Domestic Violence Online Posts	IEEE Access	"Domestic violence (DV) is not only a major health and welfare issue but also a violation of human rights. In recent years, domestic violence crisis support (DVCS) groups active on social media have proven indispensable in the support services provided to victims and their families. In the deluge of onlinegenerated content, the significant challenge arises for DVCS groups to manually detect the critical situation in a timely manner. For instance, the reports of abuse or urgent financial help solicitation are typically obscured by a vast amount of awareness campaigns or prayers for the victims. The state-of-the-art deep learning models with the embeddings approach have already demonstrated superior results in online text classification tasks. The automatic content categorization would address the scalability issue and allow the DVCS groups to intervene instantly with the exact support needed. Given the problem identified, the study aims to: 1) construct the novel ""gold standard"" dataset from social media with multi-class annotation; 2) perform the extensive experiments with multiple deep learning architectures; 3) train the domain-specific embeddings for performance improvement and knowledge discovery; and 4) produce the visualizations to facilitate models analysis and results in interpretation. The empirical evidence on a ground truth dataset has achieved an accuracy of up to 92% in classes prediction. The study validates an application of cutting edge technology to a real-world problem and proves beneficial to DVCS groups, health care practitioners, and most of all victims."

12/12/2019	4- Patch-Based Generative Adversarial Network Towards Retinal Vessel Segmentation	International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP)	"Retinal blood vessels are considered to be the reliable diagnostic biomarkers of ophthalmologic and diabetic retinopathy. Monitoring and diagnosis totally depends on expert analysis of both thin and thick retinal vessels which has recently been carried out by various artificial intelligent techniques. Existing deep learning methods attempt to segment retinal vessels using a unified loss function optimized for both thin and thick vessels with equal importance. Due to variable thickness, biased distribution, and difference in spatial features of thin and thick vessels, unified loss function are more influential towards identification of thick vessels resulting in weak segmentation. To address this problem, a conditional patch-based generative adversarial network is proposed which utilizes a generator network and a patch-based discriminator network conditioned on the sample data with an additional loss function to learn both thin and thick vessels. Experiments are conducted on publicly available STARE and DRIVE datasets which show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

14/12/2019	5- A Multi-cascaded Deep Model for Bilingual SMS Classification	International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP)	"Most studies on text classification are focused on the English language. However, short texts such as SMS are influenced by regional languages. This makes the automatic text classification task challenging due to the multilingual, informal, and noisy nature of language in the text. In this work, we propose a novel multi-cascaded deep learning model called McM for bilingual SMS classification. McM exploits n-gram level information as well as long-term dependencies of text for learning. Our approach aims to learn a model without any code-switching indication, lexical normalization, language translation, or language transliteration. The model relies entirely upon the text as no external knowledge base is utilized for learning. For this purpose, a 12 class bilingual text dataset is developed from SMS feedbacks of citizens on public services containing mixed Roman Urdu and English languages. Our model achieves high accuracy for classification on this dataset and outperforms the previous model for multilingual text classification, highlighting language independence of McM."
