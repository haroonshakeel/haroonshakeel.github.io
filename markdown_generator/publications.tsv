1/6/2018	"2- Medical Image Compression using DDCT, Ripplet transform and SPIHT"	International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research (IJSER)	"Medical images contain very significant information so very high quality images are used in medical image domain. These high quality images demand very high cost and bandwidth for storage and transmission. Therefore, image compression is very important in medical image processing. Main objective of the paper is to achieve high compression ratio and preserve 2D discontinuities/singularities as well as provide better representation of texture. In this paper, a new image compression technique is proposed. We use Directional Discrete Cosine Transform (DDCT) followed by Ripplet Transform and Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) coding. DDCT in combination with Ripplet provides better texture information and preserves 2D discontinuities/singularities. SPIHT provides better compression ratio. Experimental results show that proposed approach outperforms previous techniques in achievement of high compression ratio and texture representation."

7/3/2019	3- Deep Learning for Multi-Class Identification From Domestic Violence Online Posts	IEEE Access	"Domestic violence (DV) is not only a major health and welfare issue but also a violation of human rights. In recent years, domestic violence crisis support (DVCS) groups active on social media have proven indispensable in the support services provided to victims and their families. In the deluge of onlinegenerated content, the significant challenge arises for DVCS groups to manually detect the critical situation in a timely manner. For instance, the reports of abuse or urgent financial help solicitation are typically obscured by a vast amount of awareness campaigns or prayers for the victims. The state-of-the-art deep learning models with the embeddings approach have already demonstrated superior results in online text classification tasks. The automatic content categorization would address the scalability issue and allow the DVCS groups to intervene instantly with the exact support needed. Given the problem identified, the study aims to: 1) construct the novel ""gold standard"" dataset from social media with multi-class annotation; 2) perform the extensive experiments with multiple deep learning architectures; 3) train the domain-specific embeddings for performance improvement and knowledge discovery; and 4) produce the visualizations to facilitate models analysis and results in interpretation. The empirical evidence on a ground truth dataset has achieved an accuracy of up to 92% in classes prediction. The study validates an application of cutting edge technology to a real-world problem and proves beneficial to DVCS groups, health care practitioners, and most of all victims."

12/12/2019	4- Patch-Based Generative Adversarial Network Towards Retinal Vessel Segmentation	International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP)	"Retinal blood vessels are considered to be the reliable diagnostic biomarkers of ophthalmologic and diabetic retinopathy. Monitoring and diagnosis totally depends on expert analysis of both thin and thick retinal vessels which has recently been carried out by various artificial intelligent techniques. Existing deep learning methods attempt to segment retinal vessels using a unified loss function optimized for both thin and thick vessels with equal importance. Due to variable thickness, biased distribution, and difference in spatial features of thin and thick vessels, unified loss function are more influential towards identification of thick vessels resulting in weak segmentation. To address this problem, a conditional patch-based generative adversarial network is proposed which utilizes a generator network and a patch-based discriminator network conditioned on the sample data with an additional loss function to learn both thin and thick vessels. Experiments are conducted on publicly available STARE and DRIVE datasets which show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

14/12/2019	5- A Multi-cascaded Deep Model for Bilingual SMS Classification	International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP)	"Most studies on text classification are focused on the English language. However, short texts such as SMS are influenced by regional languages. This makes the automatic text classification task challenging due to the multilingual, informal, and noisy nature of language in the text. In this work, we propose a novel multi-cascaded deep learning model called McM for bilingual SMS classification. McM exploits n-gram level information as well as long-term dependencies of text for learning. Our approach aims to learn a model without any code-switching indication, lexical normalization, language translation, or language transliteration. The model relies entirely upon the text as no external knowledge base is utilized for learning. For this purpose, a 12 class bilingual text dataset is developed from SMS feedbacks of citizens on public services containing mixed Roman Urdu and English languages. Our model achieves high accuracy for classification on this dataset and outperforms the previous model for multilingual text classification, highlighting language independence of McM."

5/1/2020	6- A multi-cascaded model with data augmentation for enhanced paraphrase detection in short texts	Information Processing and Management (IPM)	"Paraphrase detection is an important task in text analytics with numerous applications such as plagiarism detection, duplicate question identification, and enhanced customer support helpdesks. Deep models have been proposed for representing and classifying paraphrases. These models, however, require large quantities of human-labeled data, which is expensive to obtain. In this work, we present a data augmentation strategy and a multi-cascaded model for improved paraphrase detection in short texts. Our data augmentation strategy considers the notions of paraphrases and non-paraphrases as binary relations over the set of texts. Subsequently, it uses graph theoretic concepts to efficiently generate additional paraphrase and non-paraphrase pairs in a sound manner. Our multi-cascaded model employs three supervised feature learners (cascades) based on CNN and LSTM networks with and without soft-attention. The learned features, together with hand-crafted linguistic features, are then forwarded to a discriminator network for final classification. Our model is both wide and deep and provides greater robustness across clean and noisy short texts. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets and show that it produces a comparable or state-of-the-art performance on all three."

10/1/2020	7- Language Independent Sentiment Analysis	IEEE International Conference on Advances in the Emerging Computing Technologies (AECT)	"Social media platforms and online forums generate rapid and increasing amount of textual data. Businesses, government agencies, and media organizations seek to perform sentiment analysis on this rich text data. The results of these analytics are used for adapting marketing strategies, customizing products, security and various other decision makings. Sentiment analysis has been extensively studied and various methods have been developed for it with great success. These methods, however apply to texts written in a specific language. This limits applicability to a limited demographic and a specific geographic region. In this paper we propose a general approach for sentiment analysis on data containing texts from multiple languages. This enables all the applications to utilize the results of sentiment analysis in a language oblivious or language-independent fashion."

15/1/2020	8- Adapting Deep Learning for Sentiment Classification of Code-Switched Informal Short Text	35th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing (ACM-SAC)	"Nowadays, an abundance of short text is being generated that uses nonstandard writing styles influenced by regional languages. Such informal and code-switched content are under-resourced in terms of labeled datasets and language models even for popular tasks like sentiment classification. In this work, we (1) present a labeled dataset called MultiSenti for sentiment classification of code-switched informal short text,(2) explore the feasibility of adapting resources from a resource-rich language for an informal one, and (3) propose a deep learning-based model for sentiment classification of code-switched informal short text. We aim to achieve this without any lexical normalization, language translation, or code-switching indication. The performance of the proposed models is compared with three existing multilingual sentiment classification models. The results show that the proposed model performs better in general and adapting character-based embeddings yield equivalent performance while being computationally more efficient than training word-based domain-specific embeddings."
