10/6/2015	1- Virtualization security: analysis and open challenges	International Journal of Hybrid Information Technology	"Virtualization has many applications within any organization. This makes possible virtual storage network and utilizing hardware resources efficiently. Virtualization also makes the foundations of cloud computing services, allowing users to use the hardware as an on-demand service. With all such advantages, there are also some security and privacy issues for utilizing any form of virtualization. The aim of this survey is to highlight such threats and techniques to solve these issues."	"Muhammad Arif, <strong>Muhammad Haroon Shakeel,</strong> (2015).

1/6/2018	"2- Medical Image Compression using DDCT, Ripplet transform and SPIHT"	International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research	"Medical images contain very significant information so very high quality images are used in medical image domain. These high quality images demand very high cost and bandwidth for storage and transmission. Therefore, image compression is very important in medical image processing. Main objective of the paper is to achieve high compression ratio and preserve 2D discontinuities/singularities as well as provide better representation of texture. In this paper, a new image compression technique is proposed. We use Directional Discrete Cosine Transform (DDCT) followed by Ripplet Transform and Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) coding. DDCT in combination with Ripplet provides better texture information and preserves 2D discontinuities/singularities. SPIHT provides better compression ratio. Experimental results show that proposed approach outperforms previous techniques in achievement of high compression ratio and texture representation."

7/3/2019	3- Deep Learning for Multi-Class Identification From Domestic Violence Online Posts	IEEE Access	"Domestic violence (DV) is not only a major health and welfare issue but also a violation of human rights. In recent years, domestic violence crisis support (DVCS) groups active on social media have proven indispensable in the support services provided to victims and their families. In the deluge of onlinegenerated content, the significant challenge arises for DVCS groups’ to manually detect the critical situation in a timely manner. For instance, the reports of abuse or urgent financial help solicitation are typically obscured by a vast amount of awareness campaigns or prayers for the victims. The state-of-the-art deep learning models with the embeddings approach have already demonstrated superior results in online text classification tasks. The automatic content categorization would address the scalability issue and allow the DVCS groups to intervene instantly with the exact support needed. Given the problem identified, the study aims to: 1) construct the novel ‘‘gold standard’ dataset from social media with multi-class annotation; 2) perform the extensive experiments with multiple deep learning architectures; 3) train the domain-specific embeddings for performance improvement and knowledge discovery; and 4) produce the visualizations to facilitate models analysis and results in interpretation. The empirical evidence on a ground truth dataset has achieved an accuracy of up to 92% in classes prediction. The study validates an application of cutting edge technology to a real-world problem and proves beneficial to DVCS groups, health care practitioners, and most of all victims."
