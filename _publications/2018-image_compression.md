<strong>Abstract: </strong>Medical images contain very significant information so very high quality images are used in medical image domain. These high quality images demand very high cost and bandwidth for storage and transmission. Therefore, image compression is very important in medical image processing. Main objective of the paper is to achieve high compression ratio and preserve 2D discontinuities/singularities as well as provide better representation of texture. In this paper, a new image compression technique is proposed. We use Directional Discrete Cosine Transform (DDCT) followed by Ripplet Transform and Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) coding. DDCT in combination with Ripplet provides better texture information and preserves 2D discontinuities/singularities. SPIHT provides better compression ratio. Experimental results show that proposed approach outperforms previous techniques in achievement of high compression ratio and texture representation.
